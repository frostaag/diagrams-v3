# SAP BTP Upload Workflow Disabled

## Summary

The SAP BTP Document Management upload functionality has been **DISABLED** as requested. You will no longer receive Teams notifications for SAP BTP uploads.

## What Was Disabled

The following SAP BTP related files have been moved to the `disabled-sap-btp-files/` directory:

### Workflow Files
- `sap-btp-upload.yml.disabled` - The main SAP BTP upload workflow (moved from `.github/workflows/`)

### Scripts
- `test-sap-btp-auth.sh` - SAP BTP authentication testing script
- `verify-sap-credentials.sh` - SAP BTP credential verification script  
- `trigger-sap-btp-upload.sh` - Manual SAP BTP upload trigger script

### Documentation
- `SAP_BTP_AUTH_FIX.md` - SAP BTP authentication troubleshooting guide
- `SAP_BTP_UPLOAD_WORKFLOW.md` - SAP BTP upload workflow documentation

## What Remains Active

You now have only the following workflows active:

### ✅ Active Workflows
1. **Git-based Diagram Processing** (`.github/workflows/diagrams.yml`)
   - Converts Draw.io files to PNG
   - Updates the diagrams.json API
   - Commits changes back to Git
   - Posts CSV changelog to SharePoint

2. **Diagram Viewer Deployment** (`.github/workflows/deploy-diagram-viewer.yml`)
   - Deploys the React-based diagram viewer to GitHub Pages
   - Automatically triggered when viewer code changes

## What This Means

- ❌ **No more SAP BTP uploads** - Diagrams will NOT be uploaded to SAP Document Management
- ❌ **No more Teams notifications** about SAP BTP upload status
- ✅ **Git workflow continues** - Draw.io files are still converted to PNG and committed
- ✅ **SharePoint CSV posting continues** - Changelog is still posted to SharePoint
- ✅ **Diagram viewer continues** - Web viewer remains fully functional

## To Re-enable SAP BTP (if needed in future)

If you ever want to re-enable SAP BTP uploads:

1. Move files back from `disabled-sap-btp-files/` to their original locations
2. Rename `sap-btp-upload.yml.disabled` back to `sap-btp-upload.yml` 
3. Move it back to `.github/workflows/`
4. Ensure SAP BTP environment variables are still configured in GitHub

## Current Active Functionality

Your diagram system now operates with:
1. **Draw.io editing** → **PNG conversion** → **Git storage** → **SharePoint CSV logging**
2. **Web viewer** with cache improvements for instant updates
3. **No external SAP uploads or notifications**

This simplified workflow eliminates the SAP BTP complexity while maintaining all core diagram management functionality.
