# Git Merge Conflicts - Issue Resolved

## Problem Description

The GitHub Actions workflow was experiencing Git merge conflicts when multiple commits tried to modify the `png_files/CHANGELOG.csv` file simultaneously. This was causing the workflow to fail with errors like:

```
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in png_files/CHANGELOG.csv
error: could not apply 1191c81... Generate PNG files and update changelog [skip ci]
fatal: Exiting because of an unresolved conflict.
```

## Root Cause

The issue occurred because:

1. **Concurrent Commits**: Multiple workflow runs were trying to update the same changelog file at the same time
2. **Rebase Strategy**: The workflow was using `git pull --rebase` which can cause conflicts when files are modified simultaneously
3. **Single Commit/Push Step**: The original workflow tried to pull and push in the same step, making conflict resolution difficult

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Resolved Immediate Conflicts

- **Fixed CHANGELOG.csv**: Removed all Git conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) 
- **Merged Entries**: Combined all changelog entries from both local and remote branches in chronological order
- **Preserved History**: Maintained complete history of all diagram processing attempts

### 2. Improved Workflow Architecture

#### Split Commit and Push Operations
```yaml
- name: Commit Changes
  # Only commits locally, no remote operations

- name: Push Changes with Conflict Resolution  
  # Handles all remote operations with multiple fallback strategies
```

#### Enhanced Push Strategy with Multiple Fallbacks

**Strategy 1: Simple Push**
- Attempts direct push first (fastest when no conflicts)

**Strategy 2: Merge Strategy** 
- Uses `git pull --no-rebase` instead of rebase to avoid conflicts
- Merge commits are easier to resolve automatically

**Strategy 3: Automatic Conflict Resolution**
- Detects merge conflicts automatically
- Specifically handles CHANGELOG.csv conflicts by:
  - Removing conflict markers
  - Ensuring proper CSV header
  - Removing duplicate entries
  - Merging entries chronologically

**Strategy 4: Force Push (Last Resort)**
- Uses `--force-with-lease` for safety
- Only when all other strategies fail

### 3. Conflict Prevention Features

- **Merge Instead of Rebase**: Prevents many conflict scenarios
- **Automatic Conflict Detection**: Uses `git status --porcelain` to detect conflicts
- **Smart File Handling**: Specifically handles CSV format conflicts
- **Duplicate Entry Prevention**: Uses `awk '!seen[$0]++'` to remove duplicates

## Implementation Details

### Conflict Resolution Logic
```bash
# Check if there are merge conflicts
if git status --porcelain | grep -q "^UU\|^AA\|^DD"; then
  echo "üîß Detected merge conflicts, resolving..."
  
  # Specifically handle CHANGELOG.csv conflicts
  if [[ -f "png_files/CHANGELOG.csv" ]] && git status --porcelain | grep -q "png_files/CHANGELOG.csv"; then
    echo "üîß Resolving CHANGELOG.csv conflict..."
    
    # Extract all non-conflict lines and merge them
    grep -v "^<<<<<<< HEAD\|^=======\|^>>>>>>> " png_files/CHANGELOG.csv > png_files/CHANGELOG_temp.csv
    
    # Ensure header is present and remove duplicates
    # ... (detailed implementation in workflow)
  fi
fi
```

### Benefits of New Approach

1. **Automatic Recovery**: Workflow can recover from most conflict scenarios
2. **Data Preservation**: No data loss during conflict resolution
3. **Reduced Manual Intervention**: Most conflicts resolve automatically
4. **Better Debugging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
5. **Fallback Safety**: Multiple strategies ensure push eventually succeeds

## Testing Results

- ‚úÖ **Immediate Fix**: Successfully resolved existing merge conflicts
- ‚úÖ **Workflow Update**: Enhanced workflow pushed successfully  
- ‚úÖ **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic conflict handling implemented
- ‚úÖ **Data Integrity**: All changelog entries preserved in correct order

## Future Conflict Prevention

The new workflow architecture should prevent similar issues by:

1. **Using merge strategy** instead of rebase
2. **Automatic conflict detection and resolution**
3. **Multiple fallback strategies** for push operations
4. **Smart file-specific handling** for CSV conflicts
5. **Comprehensive error handling and logging**

## Repository Note

‚ö†Ô∏è **Repository Migration Notice**: The remote shows the repository has moved to `https://github.com/frostaag/diagrams-v3.git`. Consider updating the remote URL if needed.
